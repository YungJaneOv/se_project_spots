# Spots Image Sharing Application Project

## Project Description

- Spots is a responsive web project built as a reflection of my own learning skills in what is known as Adaptive Web Design & Working with Layouts. The project showcases HTML usage, proper heading hierarchy in the development of a web page, & adaptive layouts using both Flexbox & CSS Grid in their each corresponsive manner to build the functionality of a image sharing site.

**The main features include:**

- A fully responsive design that adjusts for different screen sizes (including 320px mobile view).
- Semantic HTML tags for improved accessibility and SEO throughout the website.
- Image alt attributes for screen reader compatibility on all platforms.

## Images

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – semantic structure and accessible markup.
- **CSS3** – layout and styling with Flexbox, CSS Grid, and media queries.
- **Normalize.css** – for consistent cross-browser styling.

## Functionality

- Responsive sections that adapt to screen width including images, text, etc.
- Grid and Flex layouts for content arrangement.
- Mobile-friendly navigation and text sizing.

## Plans for Improvement

- Further optimize for performance (minify CSS, compress images).
- Add more interactive elements with JavaScript.
- Improve accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).
- Add animations and transitions for smoother UI experience.
